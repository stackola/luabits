Hi HN!

I wanted to share with you my side project in it's aplha stage. I'm calling it luabits.com

Luabits lets you create and deploy cloud functions written in Lua, directly from your browser.

Codepen, Codesandbox and the likes have made it increasingly easy to quickly prototype entire web apps in your browser. One component that's missing from that is a back end. Yes, you could set up a Firebase, but that's not as quick and frictionless as, for example, codepen.

To fill this need, I created Luabits.com. Lua bits are small scripts of Lua which are accesible via HTTPS.
These scripts have access to buckets, a nosql datastore build on top of Cloud Firestore.

Other usecases include protoypes, MVPs, low volume side projects, personal IOT devices, and anything else that can make use of https.
